Global Sustainable Plastics Market Insights
Sustainable Plastics Market size was valued at USD 15.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 45.2 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.5% from 2024 to 2030.

Sustainable Plastics Market Overview
The global sustainable plastics market was valued at USD 319.50 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.4% during the forecast period. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing adoption of eco-friendly packaging solutions, stringent government regulations promoting sustainable practices, and the need to align with various Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by legislative authorities. Additionally, the rising demand for bio-based plastics, especially in the personal care sector, is contributing to the market's expansion. For instance, Finnish beauty brand LUMENE introduced a bio-based packaging solution that includes a jar and label crafted from innovative wood-based material, processed by SABIC. The new jar and label are derived from renewable UPM BioVerno naphtha, sourced from UPM in Finland. SABIC converts the naphtha into certified renewable polypropylene, which is then utilized to create recyclable cosmetics containers and product labels, using UPM Raflatac Forest Film label material.
